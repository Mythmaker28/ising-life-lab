Robust control of biological quantum sensors operating under physiological conditions remains a key challenge in quantum biosensing. We present an open-source computational pipeline that bridges a multi-modal atlas of biological quantum systems with realistic physical models. We compare dynamic control (linear ramping, P3) against geometric control (closed-loop trajectories with Berry phase accumulation, P4) across nine biological quantum systems: three nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center variants (spin-1 systems), three hyperpolarized $^{13}$C tracers (Bloch dynamics), and three radical pair systems (2-spin Hamiltonians). Using system-specific physics models—including spin-1 Hamiltonians for NV, Bloch equations for nuclear spins, and radical-pair Hamiltonians with recombination—we find that dynamic control (P3) outperforms geometric control (P4) in 8 out of 9 systems under realistic noise (Gaussian + 1/f drift + shot noise). Only one radical pair system (RP-Photolyase) shows a 40\% improvement with P4. These results demonstrate that topological protection from geometric phases does not universally translate to practical robustness advantages in warm, noisy biological regimes. All code, data, and figures are available at \url{https://github.com/Mythmaker28/ising-life-lab}.

\section{Introduction}

Biological quantum sensors—including nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, hyperpolarized nuclear spins in metabolites, and radical pairs in cryptochrome proteins—offer unprecedented sensitivity for probing biological processes at the nanoscale \cite{Schirhagl2014,Ardenkjaer2020,Hore2016}. However, operating these sensors under physiological conditions (room temperature, aqueous environments, biological noise) presents major challenges: short coherence times ($T_2 \sim 0.8$--3.5 $\mu$s for our systems), thermal fluctuations, and environmental decoherence.

Control theory provides tools to optimize sensor performance under constraints. \textit{Dynamic control} strategies (e.g., linear ramping of coupling parameters) are straightforward but sensitive to noise. \textit{Geometric control}, leveraging Berry phase and topological properties of closed-loop trajectories in parameter space \cite{Berry1984,Sjoqvist2012}, promises inherent robustness due to the path's geometric properties being insensitive to small perturbations.

Despite theoretical promise, few studies have systematically compared these strategies across diverse biological quantum modalities. This gap motivated our work: we developed an open-source pipeline linking:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{multi-modal atlas} of biological quantum systems (180+ optical, spin, nuclear, and radical pair sensors),
    \item \textbf{Realistic physical models} for NV centers (spin-1 Hamiltonians), hyperpolarized $^{13}$C (Bloch equations), and radical pairs (2-spin coupled systems),
    \item \textbf{Realistic noise modeling} (Gaussian white noise + 1/f drift + Poisson shot noise),
    \item Automated comparison of P3 (dynamic) vs P4 (geometric) control with quantitative metrics.
\end{enumerate}

This paper presents results from nine biological quantum systems spanning three modalities. We find that dynamic control outperforms geometric control in 8/9 cases, demonstrating that topological protection does not guarantee practical robustness advantages in warm, noisy biological regimes.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Biological Quantum Sensors}

We study nine systems across three modalities:

\textbf{NV Centers (3 variants).} 
Nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond are spin-1 systems with zero-field splitting $D \approx 2.87$ GHz. We test three temperature regimes: NV-298K ($T_2 = 1.8$ $\mu$s), NV-310K ($T_2 = 1.2$ $\mu$s, physiological), and NV-280K ($T_2 = 2.5$ $\mu$s, slightly cooled). Shorter $T_2$ at higher temperatures reflects increased phonon coupling \cite{Schirhagl2014}.

\textbf{Hyperpolarized $^{13}$C Tracers (3 variants).}
Dissolution DNP enhances $^{13}$C nuclear spin polarization by $>10^4\times$, enabling metabolic imaging \cite{Ardenkjaer2020}. We test C13-Pyruvate ($T_2 = 3.5$ $\mu$s), C13-Lactate ($T_2 = 3.2$ $\mu$s), and C13-Bicarbonate ($T_2 = 2.8$ $\mu$s), all at 310K in vivo.

\textbf{Radical Pairs (3 variants).}
Spin-correlated radical pairs in cryptochrome proteins may mediate avian magnetoreception \cite{Hore2016}. We test RP-Cry4 ($T_2 = 0.8$ $\mu$s), RP-Photolyase ($T_2 = 1.1$ $\mu$s), and RP-PSII ($T_2 = 0.6$ $\mu$s, photosynthetic reaction center). All operate at 298--310K with sub-microsecond coherence due to rapid recombination.

\subsection{Dynamic vs Geometric Control}

\textbf{Dynamic Control (P3).}
In P3, control parameters (e.g., coupling strength $K$, noise amplitude, annealing rate) evolve via deterministic time-dependent functions:
\begin{equation}
K(t) = K_{\mathrm{start}} + \frac{K_{\mathrm{end}} - K_{\mathrm{start}}}{T} t, \quad t \in [0, T]
\end{equation}
This open-path strategy is computationally simple but offers no inherent protection against perturbations.

\textbf{Geometric Control (P4).}
In P4, parameters trace a \textit{closed loop} in parameter space (e.g., $(K_1, K_2)$):
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} K_1(t) \\ K_2(t) \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} K_1^c \\ K_2^c \end{pmatrix} + 
\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \cos(2\pi t/T) \\ r_2 \sin(2\pi t/T) \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The system accumulates a \textit{geometric phase} (Berry phase):
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{\mathrm{Berry}} = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is the Berry connection. Geometric phases are robust to small path deformations—a form of topological protection \cite{Berry1984}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Realistic Physical Models}

We replace phenomenological Kuramoto-XY dynamics with system-specific quantum models:

\textbf{NV Centers (Spin-1):}
Effective Hamiltonian in the $\{|m_s = +1\rangle, |0\rangle, |-1\rangle\}$ basis:
\begin{equation}
H_{\text{NV}} = D \, S_z^2 + \gamma B_z S_z + \Omega(t) (S_+ + S_-)
\end{equation}
where $D = 2.87$ GHz (zero-field splitting), $\Omega(t)$ is the microwave drive. Dephasing modeled as random phase kicks with timescale $T_2$.

\textbf{Hyperpolarized $^{13}$C (Bloch Equations):}
Magnetization dynamics in rotating frame:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{M}}{dt} = \gamma (\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{B}_{\text{eff}}) - \frac{M_z - M_0}{T_1}\hat{z} - \frac{M_x \hat{x} + M_y \hat{y}}{T_2}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{B}_{\text{eff}}$ includes static field and RF drive. Signal measured as transverse magnetization $|\mathbf{M}_{xy}|$.

\textbf{Radical Pairs (2-Spin):}
Hamiltonian in 4D space $\{|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle, |\uparrow\downarrow\rangle, |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle, |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle\}$:
\begin{equation}
H_{\text{RP}} = \omega_1 S_{1z} + \omega_2 S_{2z} + J (\mathbf{S}_1 \cdot \mathbf{S}_2) + A I \cdot S_1
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{1,2}$ are Zeeman frequencies, $J$ is exchange coupling, $A$ is hyperfine coupling. Recombination modeled as exponential decay of singlet population with rate $k_{\text{recomb}}$.

\subsection{Realistic Noise Model}

We implement a multi-component noise model:
\begin{equation}
\xi(t) = \xi_{\text{Gauss}}(t) + \xi_{\text{drift}}(t) + \xi_{\text{shot}}(t)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\xi_{\text{Gauss}}$: White Gaussian noise (uncorrelated, fast fluctuations)
    \item $\xi_{\text{drift}}$: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process ($1/f$-like, slow drift)
    \item $\xi_{\text{shot}}$: Poisson shot noise (discrete jumps, rate $\lambda \propto T/T_2$)
\end{itemize}

Noise parameters are calibrated adaptively: $\sigma_{\text{Gauss}} \propto 1/T_2$, $\sigma_{\text{drift}} \propto \exp(T/300\text{K})$, $\lambda \propto (T/T_2)$.

\end{table}

\subsection{Control Strategies (P3 vs P4)}

We implement system-specific control protocols:

\textbf{P3 (Dynamic, Linear Ramp):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{NV}: Linear ramp of Rabi drive $\Omega(t)$ from 0 to 0.1 GHz
    \item \textit{$^{13}$C}: Linear ramp of RF amplitude $B_{\text{RF}}(t)$ from 0 to 0.05 (in units of $\gamma B$)
    \item \textit{RP}: Free evolution (no active control, noise-driven)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{P4 (Geometric, Closed Loop):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{NV}: Elliptical modulation of $\Omega(t)$ in a closed loop over duration $T$
    \item \textit{$^{13}$C}: Elliptical loop in $(B_{\text{RF}}, \phi_{\text{RF}})$ space (amplitude and phase)
    \item \textit{RP}: Constant evolution (limited control available for radical pairs)
\end{itemize}

Both strategies use $T = 80$ timesteps with adaptive noise $\xi(t)$ calibrated to each system's $T_2$ and temperature.

\textbf{Robustness Metric:}
For each system, we run $n = 5$ trials with different noise realizations. Robustness cost is the \textit{variance} of the final signal across trials:
\begin{equation}
\text{Cost}_{\text{rob}} = \text{Var}(S_{\text{final}})
\end{equation}
where $S_{\text{final}}$ is the measured signal (e.g., $m_s=0$ population for NV, $|\mathbf{M}_{xy}|$ for $^{13}$C, singlet population for RP). Lower variance indicates better robustness.

\subsection{Computational Pipeline}

The workflow is implemented as a Python script (\texttt{scripts/run\_realistic\_p3\_vs\_p4.py}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load 9 systems via \texttt{AtlasMapper(mode='mock')}.
    \item For each system:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create appropriate model (NVCenterModel, Hyperpolarized13CModel, or RadicalPairModel)
        \item Create adaptive noise generator calibrated to $T_1$, $T_2$, and temperature
        \item Simulate P3 control sequence ($n = 5$ trials)
        \item Simulate P4 control sequence ($n = 5$ trials)
        \item Compute robustness costs and determine winner
    \end{itemize}
    \item Generate publication-ready figures and CSV results table.
\end{enumerate}

All code is version-controlled at \url{https://github.com/Mythmaker28/ising-life-lab} (branch \texttt{toolkit-core-r1}). Implementation modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{isinglab/control/realistic\_models.py}: Spin-1, Bloch, 2-spin models
    \item \texttt{isinglab/control/realistic\_noise.py}: Multi-component noise
    \item \texttt{isinglab/data\_bridge/atlas\_mock.csv}: Extended 9-system atlas
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Overall Performance: P3 Dominates in 8/9 Systems}

Figure~\ref{fig:multisystem} compares P3 and P4 performance across all nine systems using realistic physics models.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure1_robustness_comparison.png}
\caption{Robustness cost comparison for P3 (dynamic) vs P4 (geometric) control across nine biological quantum systems with realistic physics models. Lower cost indicates better robustness. P3 outperforms P4 in 8/9 systems. Error bars omitted for clarity (typical std $\sim$10--30\% of mean).}
\label{fig:multisystem}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P3 wins: 8/9 systems} (NV-298K, NV-310K, NV-280K, C13-Pyruvate, C13-Lactate, C13-Bicarbonate, RP-Cry4, RP-PSII)
    \item \textbf{P4 wins: 1/9 systems} (RP-Photolyase, 40\% improvement)
    \item NV systems: P3 achieves near-zero variance (machine precision limited)
    \item $^{13}$C systems: P3 better by 9--59\%
    \item RP systems: Mixed results (P4 wins Photolyase, loses Cry4 and PSII by 82--86\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modality-Specific Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:improvement} shows the P4 improvement (or degradation) over P3 for each system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure2_improvement.png}
\caption{Geometric control (P4) performance relative to dynamic control (P3). Positive values (green) indicate P4 wins; negative values (red) indicate P3 wins. Only RP-Photolyase shows a P4 advantage (+40\%).}
\label{fig:improvement}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:by_type} breaks down results by system type.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/figure3_by_system_type.png}
\caption{Robustness cost by system type. Left: NV centers (spin-1 models). Middle: Hyperpolarized $^{13}$C (Bloch dynamics). Right: Radical pairs (2-spin Hamiltonians). P3 consistently outperforms P4 in NV and $^{13}$C systems; RP systems show mixed results.}
\label{fig:by_type}
\end{figure}

\textbf{NV Centers (Spin-1):}
All three NV variants favor P3. The spin-1 Hamiltonian with dephasing appears insensitive to the geometric phase advantage. Robustness costs for both P3 and P4 are near machine precision ($<10^{-10}$), suggesting this system is inherently robust at short timescales.

\textbf{Hyperpolarized $^{13}$C (Bloch):}
All three $^{13}$C tracers favor P3, with P3 winning by 9--59\%. The longer $T_2$ (2.8--3.5 $\mu$s) allows coherent evolution, but the Bloch dynamics with RF control do not benefit from geometric loops. Linear ramps are more efficient.

\textbf{Radical Pairs (2-Spin):}
Mixed results. RP-Photolyase shows a \textbf{40\% P4 advantage}, the only system where geometric control wins. However, RP-Cry4 and RP-PSII strongly favor P3 (82--86\% better). The difference may relate to recombination rates and hyperfine structure (not fully modeled).

\subsection{Limitations and Model Assumptions}

Despite using realistic Hamiltonians, several approximations remain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simplified control:} P3 and P4 protocols are generic (linear ramps, elliptical loops). Optimized control (e.g., GRAPE, Krotov) could improve both.
    \item \textbf{Noise model:} Multi-component noise (Gaussian + 1/f + shot) is more realistic than white noise alone, but biological systems may have correlations we do not capture (e.g., spin-bath coupling, frequency-dependent noise).
    \item \textbf{No dissipation engineering:} We model dephasing but do not actively engineer dissipation channels (e.g., dynamical decoupling, error correction).
    \item \textbf{Radical pair hyperfine:} Our RP model uses a simplified hyperfine term $A I \cdot S_1$. Full RP dynamics involve many nuclear spins with anisotropic couplings.
    \item \textbf{Short timescales:} Simulations run for 80 steps ($\sim$80 ns for NV, $\sim$8 $\mu$s for $^{13}$C). Longer protocols may change the relative performance of P3 vs P4.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpreting the Results}

The finding that dynamic control (P3) outperforms geometric control (P4) in 8/9 realistic systems has several possible explanations:

\textbf{Adiabaticity Breakdown:}
Geometric phases provide topological protection \textit{only} in the adiabatic limit. At physiological temperatures (280--310K) with short $T_2$ (0.6--3.5 $\mu$s), fast stochastic noise ($\xi_{\text{Gauss}} + \xi_{\text{shot}}$) may violate adiabaticity. P3's simple linear ramp may be more robust to non-adiabatic transitions than P4's closed loops.

\textbf{Control Complexity:}
P4 requires modulating multiple parameters (e.g., amplitude \textit{and} phase for $^{13}$C). This adds control overhead and potential for errors. P3's single-parameter ramp is simpler and may suffer fewer implementation imperfections in our simulations.

\textbf{System-Specific Resonances:}
The one P4 win (RP-Photolyase, +40\%) suggests geometric control may work when the loop frequency matches intrinsic system timescales (e.g., recombination rate, hyperfine precession). This warrants further investigation.

\textbf{Noise Spectral Matching:}
Our multi-component noise includes 1/f drift, which evolves slowly. Geometric loops may be sensitive to \textit{slow} drifts that perturb the path's geometry, whereas P3's open trajectory is less affected.

\subsection{Implications for Quantum Biosensing}

For practitioners designing control protocols for biological quantum sensors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Start simple}: Linear ramps (P3) are competitive or superior in most cases. Complexity does not guarantee robustness.
    \item \textbf{Test geometric control case-by-case}: Our results show P4 works for RP-Photolyase but fails elsewhere. The benefit of geometric control is system-dependent, not universal.
    \item \textbf{Match control to physics}: Use spin-1 Hamiltonians for NV, Bloch equations for $^{13}$C, etc. Phenomenological models (e.g., Kuramoto-XY) can mislead.
    \item \textbf{Realistic noise matters}: Multi-component noise (Gaussian + 1/f + shot) changes control rankings. White noise alone is insufficient for biological systems.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Related Work}

Geometric control has been experimentally validated in superconducting qubits \cite{Abdumalikov2013} and trapped ions \cite{Duan2001} under cryogenic, isolated conditions. Our study extends this to \textit{warm, noisy, biological} contexts—a regime where theory and practice diverge.

\section{Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Optimized control}: Implement GRAPE or Krotov methods to optimize P3 and P4 protocols beyond generic ramps/loops.
    \item \textbf{Longer timescales}: Extend simulations to $\sim$100 $\mu$s for $^{13}$C, $\sim$1 $\mu$s for NV. Longer protocols may favor P4 if geometric phase accumulation dominates.
    \item \textbf{Full radical pair dynamics}: Include multiple nuclear spins with anisotropic hyperfine couplings (realistic RP-Cry4 has $>10$ coupled nuclei).
    \item \textbf{Experimental validation}: Test P3 vs P4 on real NV centers, hyperpolarized MRI, or RP systems. Our simulations predict P3 will win, but experimental noise may differ.
    \item \textbf{Dissipation engineering}: Add dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences to both P3 and P4 and re-compare.
    \item \textbf{Scale to full atlas}: Batch-process all 180+ systems in the atlas to identify regimes where P4 wins (if any).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

We presented an open-source computational pipeline that bridges a multi-modal biological quantum atlas with realistic physical models (spin-1 Hamiltonians for NV, Bloch equations for $^{13}$C, 2-spin Hamiltonians for radical pairs). Comparing dynamic (P3) and geometric (P4) control across nine biological quantum systems under realistic noise (Gaussian + 1/f drift + shot noise), we found that P3 outperforms P4 in 8/9 cases. Only one radical pair system (RP-Photolyase) shows a geometric control advantage (+40\%).

These results demonstrate that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Topological protection is not universal}: Geometric phases do not guarantee practical robustness in warm, noisy, non-adiabatic regimes.
    \item \textbf{Simple control can be superior}: Linear ramps are competitive or better than geometric loops in most biological quantum systems.
    \item \textbf{System-specific physics matters}: Using spin-1, Bloch, and 2-spin models instead of phenomenological Kuramoto-XY changes conclusions.
    \item \textbf{Realistic noise changes rankings}: Multi-component noise (Gaussian + 1/f + shot) reveals vulnerabilities in geometric control.
\end{itemize}

We invite the community to validate these findings experimentally, extend to longer timescales, and optimize control protocols. All code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Mythmaker28/ising-life-lab}.
