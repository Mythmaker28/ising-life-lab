Robust control of biological quantum sensors operating under physiological conditions remains a key challenge in quantum biosensing. We present an open-source computational pipeline that bridges a multi-modal atlas of biological quantum systems with a phase-coupled oscillator control engine (Ising-Life-Lab). We compare dynamic control (linear ramping, P3) against geometric control (closed-loop trajectories with Berry phase accumulation, P4) across three representative biological quantum systems: nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at room temperature (298K), hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate for metabolic imaging (310K), and radical pair cryptochrome for avian magnetoreception (310K). Our results show that, in this toy Kuramoto-XY model, dynamic control (P3) achieves lower robustness costs (0.00 vs 0.01-0.10) despite the theoretical expectation of topological protection in geometric trajectories. However, P4 exhibits marginally better stability variance (~1.1x). These findings highlight the gap between idealized geometric control theory and practical implementation in noisy biological regimes, and demonstrate the value of reproducible computational pipelines for quantum biosensing research.
