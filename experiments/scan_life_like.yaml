# Configuration for scanning Life-like CA rules
# These are 2D CAs with birth/survival rules (like Conway's Game of Life)

# For Life-like rules, we sample interesting rule space
# Rule encoding: bits 0-8 for birth, bits 9-17 for survival

# We'll manually specify some interesting Life-like rules to scan
# Rule 224 = Conway's Life (B3/S23)
# Rule format: sum(2^b for b in birth) + sum(2^(s+9) for s in survival)

# Note: For Life-like, rule_range is approximate
# The scanner will generate Life-like rules appropriately
rule_range: [0, 262143]  # 2^18 - 1 (18 bits total)
