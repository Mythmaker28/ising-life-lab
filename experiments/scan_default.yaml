# Default configuration for CA rule scanning
# Usage: python -m isinglab.scan_rules --config experiments/scan_default.yaml

# Rule range to scan (inclusive)
rule_range: [0, 255]

# Type of cellular automaton
# Options: "elementary", "life", "totalistic"
ca_type: "elementary"

# Grid dimensions
# For 1D CA: [width]
# For 2D CA: [height, width]
grid_size: [100]

# Number of evolution steps
steps: 200

# Random seed for reproducibility
seed: 42

# Number of different initial conditions per rule
# Higher values give more robust statistics but take longer

# Number of top rules to save separately
top_n: 20

# Metric for ranking top rules
# Options: "edge_score", "memory_score", "entropy", "sensitivity"
